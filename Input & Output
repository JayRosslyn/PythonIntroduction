#1 Write a program named greeter.py. This program should ask for name, then output Hello, Name!

name = input("What is your name? ")
print (f"Hello, {name}!")

#2 Modify the greeter.py program to ask for the user's first and last names separately, then greet with full name:

first_name = input("What is your first name? ")
last_name = input("What is your last name? ")
print (f"Hello {first_name} {last_name}!")

#3 Write a program named age.py that asks for user age, then calculates and reports the future age, 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now:

age = int(input("How old are you? "))
print()
print(f"You are {age} years old.")
print(f"In 10 years, you will be {age + 10} years old.")
print(f"In 20 years, you will be {age + 20} years old.")
print(f"In 30 years, you will be {age + 30} years old.")
print(f"In 40 years, you will be {age + 40} years old.")
