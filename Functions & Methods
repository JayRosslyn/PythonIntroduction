#1 The program will output a NameError because 'foo' is not defined.

#2 This program will display "bar" because the 'foo' variable is only updated in the function block.

#3 Write a program that uses a multiply function:
first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print (first_number * second_number)

#4 Identify the following items in the code:
Function name: multiply_numbers
Function arguments: 2, 3, 4
Function definition: lines 1-3
Function body: lines 2 and 3
Function parameters: num1, num2, and num3
Function invocation: multiply_numbers(2, 3, 4)
Function return value: 24
All identifiers: multiply_numbers, num1, num2, num3, result, and product

#5 This code doesn't display anything because there is no print command in the code

#6 This code doesn't display anything because of the return call on line 3

#7 This code will raise an error because of 'qux'

#8 This code will raise an error because there are too many arguments

#9 This code will print the arguments, thus printing # 42, 3.141592, 2.718

#10 This will assign the third argument to the third parameter, thus printing # 42, 3.141592, 2

#11 This will assign the single argument to the first parameter and print along with the 2nd and 3rd pre-assigned parameters. 

#12 This will raise an error because the first parameter has no default value unlike the 2nd and 3rd parameters.

#13 This will raise an error because the 3rd parameter must have a default value if the prior parameters have one.

#14 The identifiers are mutiply, left, right, first_number, second_number, get_num, prompt, float, input, product, and print.

#15 The global identifiers are multiply, get_num, first_number, second_number, product. The local identifiers are left,
right, prompt. The built-in identifiers are float, input, print.

#16 Line 1 and 9 contain multiply functions, lines 4, 7, 8 contain the get_num function, line 5 contains the float and input
functions, line 10 contains the print function. Left and right parameters are on line 1 and 2. Prompt paramter is on lines 4 and 5.

#17 The function is say, the methods are .upper() and .lower(), and the built-in functions are print, input, and max

#18 numbers_1 and numbers_2 will return True, numbers_3 and numbers_4 will return False.

#19 numbers_1 and numbers_3 will return False, numbers_2 and numbers_4 will return True.
