#1 What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

The program will output a NameError because 'foo' is not defined.

#2 What does this program print? Why?

This program will display "bar" because the 'foo' variable is only updated in the function block.

#3 Write a program that uses a multiply function:

first_number = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
second_number = int(input("Enter the second number: "))
print (first_number * second_number)

#4 Identify the following items in the code:

Function name: multiply_numbers
Function arguments: 2, 3, 4
Function definition: lines 1-3
Function body: lines 2 and 3
Function parameters: num1, num2, and num3
Function invocation: multiply_numbers(2, 3, 4)
Function return value: 24
All identifiers: multiply_numbers, num1, num2, num3, result, and product

#5 This code doesn't display anything because there is no print command in the code

#6 This code doesn't display anything because of the return call on line 3

#7 This code will raise an error because of 'qux'

#8 This code will raise an error because there are too many arguments

#9 This code will print the arguments

#10
