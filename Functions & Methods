#1 What happens when you run the following program? Why do we get that result?

The program will output a NameError because 'foo' is not defined.

#2 What does this program print? Why?

This program will display "bar" because the 'foo' variable is only updated in the function block.

#3 Write a program that uses a multiply function:

first_number = input
