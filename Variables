#1 Classify the following potiential non-constant variables as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal. For non-idiomatic or illegal, explain your choice:

index = idiomatic
CatName = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
lazy_dog = idiomatic
quick_Fox = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
1stCharacter = illegal because this begins with a number
operand2 = idiomatic
BIG_NUMBER = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
pi symbol = non-idiomatic because this is uses a non-ASCII character

#2 Classify the following potential function names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal:

index = idiomatic
CatName = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
lazy_dog = idiomatic
quick_Fox = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
1stCharacter = illegal because this begins with a number
operand2 = idiomatic
BIG_NUMBER = non-idiomatic because this uses uppercase letters
pi symbol = non-idiomatic because this is uses a non-ASCII character

#3 Classify the following potential constant names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal:

index = non-idiotmatic because of lowercase letters
CatName = non-idiomatic because of lowercase letters
snake_case = non-idiomatic because of lowercase letters
LAZY_DOG3 = idiomatic
1ST = illegal because it begins with a number
operand2 = non-idiomatic because of lowercase letters
BIG_NUMBER = idiomatic
Π = non-idiomatic because it uses a non-ASCII character

#4 Classify the following potential class names as idiomatic, non-idiomatic, or illegal:

index = non-idiomatic because it begins with a lowercase letter
CatName = idiomatic
Lazy_Dog = non-idiomatic because it contains an underscore
1st = illegal because it begins with a number
operand2 = non-idiomatic because it begins with a lowercase letter
BigNumber3 = idiomatic
Πi = non-idiomatic because it uses a non-ASCII character

#5 Write a program that greets Victor three times:

name = "Victor"
print ('Good morning, ' + name + '.')
print ('Good afternoon, ' + name + '.')
print ('Good evening, ' + name + '.')

#6 Write a program that includes someone's age and then calculates and reports the future age 10, 20, 30, 40 years from now:

age = 22
print (f"You are {age} years old.")
print (f"In 10 years, you will be {age + 10} years old.")
print (f"In 20 years, you will be age {age + 20} years old.")
print (f"In 30 years, you will be age {age + 30} years old.")
print (f"In 40 years, you will be age {age + 40} years old.")

#7 What happens when you run the following code and why?

This code will greet Victor three times and then greet Nina three times.

#8 

balance = (1000.00 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05 * 1.05)
print (balance)

#9

balance = 1000.00
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
balance *= 1.05
print (balance)

#10

obj = 'ABcd' is a reassignment
obj.upper() is neither
obj = obj.lower() is a reassignment
print(len(obj)) is neither
obj = list(obj) is a reassignment
obj.pop() is a mutation
obj[2] = 'X" is a mutation
obj.sort() is a mutation
set(obj) is neither
obj = tuple(obj) is a reassignment
